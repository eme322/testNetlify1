      <p class="line">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</p>
      <p class="line">And sorry I could not travel both</p>
      <p class="line">And be one traveler, long I stood</p>
      <p class="line">And looked down one as far as I could</p>
      <p class="line">To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
      <p class="line">Then took the other, as just as fair,</p>
      <p class="line">And having perhaps the better claim,</p>
      <p class="line">Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</p>
      <p class="line">Though as for that the passing there</p>
      <p class="line">Had worn them really about the same,</p>
      <p class="line">And both that morning equally lay</p>
      <p class="line">In leaves no step had trodden black.</p>
      <p class="line">Oh, I kept the first for another day!</p>
      <p class="line">Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</p>
      <p class="line">I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
      <p class="line">I shall be telling this with a sigh</p>
      <p class="line">Somewhere ages and ages hence:</p>
      <p class="line">Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”</p>
      <p class="line">I took the one less traveled by,</p>
      <p class="line">And that has made all the difference.</p>
